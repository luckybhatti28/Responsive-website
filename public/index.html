            <p class="sectionSubtag Text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational.</p>

            <p class="  Text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
                As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

            <p class="  Text-small">This is ISCED level 1.[17] Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first
                four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to
                eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and
                sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled
                in primary education, and this proportion was rising.[21][full citation needed] Under the Education For
                All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in
                primary education by 2015, and in many countries. <br>
                In India, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary
                education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. National
